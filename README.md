# Leto

Leto is a video conferencing app that allows users to hold online meetings with others via audio, video, chat, and screen sharing. 
Users can join meetings by using a meeting link. Moreover, user can schedule meeting for later in their convenient date and time. 
Upcoming meeting details and previous meeting histories are listed separately which helps to keep track of all the meetings. 

Additionally, there is a separate section for storing recorded meetings. The meetings are not automatically recorded but if the user wants to record the meeting, 
he/she can start recording and it will be stored in recordings section so that user can watch those recordings later or send to other people via link.
